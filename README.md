# This is a project done over the course of October and November 2016. With 3 other colleagues, we built a plotter using C++, RobotC and Mindstorms NXT. The features of this plotter include: being able to plot images of multiple colors, and being able to receive SVG files as input. 
I helped to develop a code capable of parsing SVG files which are slightly modified (to a certain format). I also developed a code capable of fitting lines into curves so that curves can be plotted through linear motor movements. This was done primarily by implementing algorithms for Bezier quadratic and cubic curves. This code writes a line of coordinates to a file, which is then read by a RobotC program and translated into motor movements.  
The project was a success, and we managed to plot letters, shapes and curves (sine, quadratic and cubic curves).
